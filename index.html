            <div>The question arises - who am I? Well, who are you? You could tell me your occupation, your title,
                information about where you grew up, but that's not who you are. I want to know how you got 
                to where you are, and more importantly <i>why </i>you are. So here's why I am.</div>
            <div>I grew up in a small town in Rhode Island with a younger brother and my dad. I never imagined a life
                beyond that - and now I'm in what I would consider a big city - Rochester, New York. My school has more students
                than my town had people.</div>
            <div>Growing up, I was never sure of what I wanted to do exactly - my main goal was to help people and create a positive
                impact. How I was going to do that I had no idea. Everything under the sun interested me from science, math, education,
                art, language - it was definitely difficult to narrow down one field to go into. But programming? Well, that never crossed
                my mind as an option until I was in my junior year of high school.</div>
            <div> If you told me that I would be making my own website from scratch, that I would be pursuing a career in development,
                I probably would have thought you were joking. It seemed so far away, so unattainable. I worked throughout highschool
                to help keep my family afloat and to be able to afford AP classes, and, when the time came, college applications. So entering
                the white collar workforce never really occurred to me.</div>
            <div> I do what I do to help people, plain and simple. But what do I do? <br/>
                I'm a third year Web and Mobile Computing major at Rochester Institute of Technology with a minor in American Sign
                Language and Deaf Cultural Studies, and a concentration in Mobile Development. So what does any of that mean? 
                It means that I make websites, I make apps, I make software, and I do it for good causes, for good companies, for good people.</div>
